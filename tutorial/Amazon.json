To prevent this, one needs to remove the container after six minutes, give the contents a good shake and cook for six minutes more. I have found that this can still leave sections that are not brown and shake the container twice, once after four and again eight minutes. To improve the flavour, I cut the potatoes into chips, dry them off, and then brush them over with Olive Oil before cooking. It takes a while to get used to, but is a lot easier and cleaner than using a deep fat fryer, and wins over the Tefal Actifry because of the time saving.", "link": "/gp/customer-reviews/R2A8W64CL8SYD8?ASIN=B0042EU3A2"},

My family are fussy eaters, but are completely in agreement about the excellence of this gadget. As it is not too large (easily fitting under my upper kitchen units) I'm actually considering buying a SECOND one (with the baking accessory included!) as it is only large enough to cook four portions of anything at once. The divider works well for cooking protein one side and veg the other, but really only enough to feed two people (unless you are much stronger willed than we are at resisting delicious food.) I've found it particularly useful for producing puddings without having to be nipping in and out of the kitchen during a meal, as it cooks so quickly that starting it at the same time as clearing main course plates has allowed me to spend more time enjoying the meal, too.", "link": "/gp/customer-reviews/R14RSKZY0O2U3X?ASIN=B0042EU3A2"},

Used it for the first time this evening, made marinated chicken drumsticks and French fries. I must say that I was sceptical about the quality of the food cooked in this way. No more. I first did the chicken for 20 minutes (15 would've been fine too). Perfect is a big word, so I leave it in amazing. Crispy skin and juicy; thoroughly cooked inside. Zero greasiness. The chips in 15 minutes were simply perfect. Better than fried with oil, %100. Crunchy, golden outside and soft and fluffy inside. The only downside is the size of the basket. Is early days yet, but I almost wish I had bought a model with a bigger basket now. Compared to frying the same meal the traditional way, is like comparing the performance of a Ferrari against a push bike. It took less than 40 minutes to have perfectly cooked Chicken and Chips for two people. No smoke, oil-spitting, hardly any smell. Easy to wash and store away. It is also very safe and even kids could use it safely with a little supervision. I think this model is great for people living alone and couples, mostly because of size of basket. I didn't think you could have clean-tasting, delicious fried food without oil, but there it is.

So far she's made a few servings of chips, some roast potato's and spicy chicken. All of which have been delicious. There's also less cooking smell afterwards. My better half says it takes about 20 minutes to cook chips and they come out golden brown and crunchy. Assuming it doesn't pack up prematurely, I'd say this was a great buy.

It is the cheapest from Amazon who I love to buy from as their back up if ever need is just first class. It arrived very quickly too .

You need an ovenware dish of if round 20cm or square 19x19 cm on outer edges no more than 8cm deep. It does state this in the booklet that comes with the air fryer but if your like me I tend to not read everything. Once brought the dishes the food was excellent very tasty.

The only reason I would still put chips in the oven is if it were going to be on anyway. Jacket potatoes are brilliant, lovely crisp skins and so soft in the middle. Only thing I would say,start the jackets off in the microwave for a few minutes then transfer to the Air fryer, we found they took an awfully long time to cook solely in the Airfryer. Pasties and Battered Onions heat up and are lovely and crispy. So keeps our cholesterol down. In fact hubby's cholesterol was down to 4.2 recently. Obviously I cannot say it was down to the Airfryer but it certainly helps. We don't find it noisy like others have commented. We do shake the chips frequently to make them cook evenly but not a problem. For a healthier way of eating chips  you cannot better it. The airfryer looks good too and we haven't noticed finger marks as I thought we might being shiny black. I was hoping to buy the matt black one that has digital controls but even though it is advertised in Argos and Homebase it isn't actually available in the UK until Autumn which is a bit misleading.

Ignore the reviews that compare it to a deep fat fryer - it is not a replacement, and the name kind of sets it up for a fall really! This is basically a small fan-assisted oven that gets to temperature in three minutes. In doing so, it saves a lot of time and electricity, and we rarely use our main oven anymore. It's particularly good for making crunchy jacket potatoes - just turn the temp to max, rinse your potatoes in cold water, sprinkle them with salt, and cook for 40 or so minutes depending on the size (you will need to turn the timer again as its max is 30 mins). Oven chips come out really well and are done in 15 minutes with a shake halfway through, and it's suitable for everything from cooking sausages to heating pies, even toasting bread. Because the hot air circulates so ferociously, it also makes the best roast potatoes, just make sure they get a good bit of oil before you put them in. You can obviously spray a drop of oil on anything you wish to cook once it's inside, but I tend to find that you can only get to the top area easily. If you plan to heat Quiches or anything with a delicate top, either cover it or turn the heat down and cook it for longer. The source of the heat is the equivalent of a kettle's thermostat with a fan behind it, so it is possible to burn things if you're not used to it. At the current price, this is great value - I paid \u00a3160 for my original one four years ago. It only has two controls so it's easy to use, it's easy to clean, and overall it's been an excellent purchase.

I wasn't convinced until I tested it myself.  I make chicken without any oil and my family are simply blown away that there is no oil added.  I no longer ever fry chips as they go in here and are cooked within 10 minutes or so.  It does everything that it claims.  I found the grill difficult to clean, especially with chicken, so I line the basket with a piece of foil at the bottom, that way once the cooking is done, I simply throw out the foil, brilliant.  I recently bought my second one in the off white colour for my work-home, it is well worth the price as it is an investment in health.  Would highly recommend to anyone who hates the smell of oil when frying, or the time it takes to oven bake ( there is no smell of oil, and the time it takes is much less than a conventional oven).  You simply turn the knob to the desired time for cooking (the manual tells you the timing needed for whatever you're cooking) and then you can go off and do other things.  The fryer simply turns off when it's done.  Food doesn't become dry like with other ovens I've tried.  This is by far the best electric item I'd invest in. Highly recommend!", "link": "/gp/customer-reviews/R1N1MAAKCJZQMF?ASIN=B0042EU3A2"},

With the deep fat fryer the process of making home made chips required merely peeling and chopping the potatoes and dropping the in the fryer.  With the Philips air fryer the process is a bit more involved.  After having been chopped into shape your chips will need to be patted dry with a paper towel or similar and then oiled prior to cooking.  The manual also recommends soaking the chips for 30 minutes prior to drying and oiling them but I have found this to make little difference and no longer bother with this stage.  On the plus side the resulting chips are crisper than those I cooked using a deep fat fryer and are presumably healthier too.  Also my flat-mates have been impressed with how well the air fryer cooks oven chips (which are what it is actually designed for) and it is less smelly and easier to clean than the deep fat fryer.", "link": "/gp/customer-reviews/R1U69WXYGLIKDC?ASIN=B0042EU3A2"},

I swithered for ages whether to get an airfryer to replace my old deep fat fryer, mainly because deep fat fryers are so messy but also from a health point of view. I'm not gonna lie, the airfryer is a breeze to keep clean and of course it's a much healthier way to fry food. That being said, all the food I specifically got it for, frozen chips, fish fingers, roast potatoes etc taste completely different to how they do when they're traditionally fried. You don't get the crispness. To add to my disappointment, the front no longer stays in place so it belches steam after 20 minutes or so. I rarely ever use it now as I get much better results using my oven. I wouldn't go back to deep fat fryers but if I'd known then what I know now I'd have saved my money as these airfyers are hugely over-rated in my humble opinion.", "link": "/gp/customer-reviews/R2K9847IXIANU8?ASIN=B0042EU3A2"},

I also use a vaporiser filled with oil just to make sure they are coated. Using the normal setting for chips 180DEG for 20mins (after heating for 5mins) - Shake after 10mins (I also spray a fresh coting of oil on them at this point) and you will get great chips.

Frozen chips cooked like a dream in half the time, came out crisp and gorgeously fluffy inside.  My own home made chips were fab, but took another few minutes to get the golden colour I wanted.  Tasted great.  I tried my famous chicken pie by baking the pastry  'blind'  in a tin which fitted the basket, 10 minutes later I filled it with cooked chicken keftover from a roast dinner, added mushrooms and a lovely sauce, put the pastry lid on, and 12 minutes later had a pie to die for!  I am still experimenting, and just wish it was slightly larger so I could cook fish and chips side by side!

If any part of the food is shielded from the blast of hot air it is not going to be cooked. With chips in particular, loading the basket more than about half-full makes even cooking difficuly to ensure, and the recommended shake halfway through cooking does not do the job.

However, in the short time the tall Philips has sat on our worktop it has cooked items as diverse as fishcakes and parsnips (love 'em) succesfully and quicker than a conventional oven would do.

I open the sliding drawer, pop the chips in the basket then close it. (Note, for oven chips you don't have to even put any oil in the fryer). After about 7 minutes I simply pull out the drawer, shake it to break up the chips in the basket and then pop them back in. After anther 7 minutes the timer pings and my chips are ready to perfection. Ok I admit, it only pings once which is not ideal but everything shuts down once the timer has gone off so if you don't hear it, your food won't keep cooking and get ruined and if you know your cooking something that takes less then 15 minutes, even if you don't hear the ping your going to be watching the time anyhow and let's be honest old fashioned egg timers never made any sound but I still managed to get the results I needed. Note your cooking time will vary depending on the quantity of food in your basket but there is a guideline that comes with your AirFryer and as they say practice does make perfect.", "link": "/gp/customer-reviews/R28O5NY56XJZ9E?ASIN=B0042EU3A2"},

Other reviews also say its really big, again I would have to question this and say in comparison to what, a hand blender, Yes and cake mixer or slow cooker No. I have a small kitchen and it fits perfectly in the corner of the worktop and with its slick black finish sometimes it's hardly noticeable. Other things I also really like are the easy cord storage that feeds into the base and allows me to conceal any unnecessary cable plus the fact that if all the hard work of cooking exhausts me and I can't manage to wash up, the main drawer and basket of the fryer are both dishwasher proof.

The instructions suggested using a teaspoon of oil on potatoes to prevent drying out but I decided a couple of sprays of the '1 cal' oil and a bit of garlic for seasoning would do the trick.

I was really looking forward to the crispy chips that so many people were writing about, however so far I have not managed to get that result myself. The chips I get are either burnt or undercooked and soggy. I have tried the official instructions as well as longer and shorter timings with lots of shaking etc, I have tried pre-cooking the chips, I have tried thinner and thicker cuts and I have tried different potatoes and oils, but still no crispy chips! I have not tried any ready made oven chips from the supermarket or any other type of food, but I am starting to feel this was a waste of money. One other thing is that you can't reduce the timer once you have turned the dial. So far the only positive thing I can think of regarding this product is the ease of cleaning in the dishwasher. If anybody has a suggestion to improve my results I would be very grateful!", "link": "/gp/customer-reviews/RVUCKL8RO9TPU?ASIN=B0042EU3A2"},

It lasted less than a few months in my kitchen. I thought that products like this should last a number of years especially if it was a so called \u201cPhillips\u201d brand. In less than a few months of buying it the Air Fryer came to a complete HALT. A COMPLETE HALT!! No light on or anything!! I\u2019ve always had doubts in the Phillips brand but this time I was proven right. After I discovered that the product was dead I got in touch with customer service at Phillips and they promised to respond to my complaint but then just couldn\u2019t be bothered to give me a reply in writing. I spoke to them on more than 2-3 occasions but then decided they couldn\u2019t do anything because it was bought from e-bay. I simply gave up. All I can say is that I am not happy with Phillips or their customer service staff. From my experience the machine is simply not ROBUST. Please don\u2019t fall into the same trap I did!!!

Following the instructions I got pretty much the same results each time, some cooked all the way through, some not. It doesn't really crisp up the chip, no more than an oven would do anyway. I also did some fish fingers, but then any kind of heat could cook them. I then tried to cook some chicken legs. Frequent turning is necessary as the chicken skin went black quite quickly.

I prepared the chips and then added the oil thoroughly shaking the basket to ensure an as even as possible coating. I then set the timer and temperature as per the instructions. The instructions state that at the halfway point that the basket be removed and shaken.

In that respect it is quite similar to a Tefal product that I had once considered purchasing, other than learning of its reported problems. Both fryers require about 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of oil, but where the Tefal requires that the oil be added to the fryer, the Philips requires that the food be either tossed in or brushed with oil before placing in the fryer. It does not require a great deal of surface space to use, but it is quite tall and storage in most cupboards could be an issue. No dust cover is provided or offered so worktop storage could be problematic. It is quite noisy in  use, due to the fan, but the timer is the clockwork type that emits a 'ding' when finished. Unless you are in quite close vicinity, or there is little background noise either from a TV, radio or the kids, you may not hear it. A digital timer with a more pronounced warning, would at this price break, have made rather more sense.", "link": "/gp/customer-reviews/R3UOMNX69UZXQQ?ASIN=B0042EU3A2"},

Some lasted for 3-5 years, others rather less but none were in the same price league as this. It relies on a fan to draw in air from the top and pass it over an element not unlike that found in older electric kettles. The pan has a shaped segment in its base that is supposed to swirl the air around and to pass it back up through the food, cooking the food more or less evenly on both sides. It works to some extent but is far from perfect. If there is a single layer of something, it can perform quite well, but if there are multiple layers as with chips then it basically fails for reasons explained below,", "link": "/gp/customer-reviews/R206HCMYOI7BXD?ASIN=B0042EU3A2"},
{"rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on 12 November 2016", "review": "The promises are many but performance in most cases fell rather short. When cooking chips, not the oven-ready type, despite cooking for the recommended time or more, shaking the contents as recommended after about 60% and again at about 80% of the time has elapsed, most were invariably still either mostly white or were browned only in a few places. However, it was often the case that corners were burned even though much of the chip looked uncooked. Sometimes, a few were still quite raw in places and the flavour and texture is quite different and may need time to be accepted. The only effective way to ensure even cooking is to turn each chip over so that its least cooked surfaces are nearer to the element - not the most time-efficient or practical solution. As most buyers will probably consider this as a chip fryer and nothing more, it is not ideal for the job. At its current price, even after Amazon reduced their prices by over 1/3 despite a rise in VAT, it is not the most cost-effective or simply the most effective solution. It is also seems rather slow; for example chips require about 12-15 minutes plus 3 minutes more to preheat which is about twice as long as in a deep fryer although the oil will need some time to heat. Steaks require about 10-12 minutes plus preheating time compared with about 3 or 4 in an electric grill, although the latter will need to be heated before use.", "link": "/gp/customer-reviews/R20JAUI3OKI24F?ASIN=B0042EU3A2"},
